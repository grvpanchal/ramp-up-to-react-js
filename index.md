# Overview
This is a quick guide to ramp up to React JS by beginning with essential HTMl CSS and JavaScript knowledge to code in React. Initially when I started React without knowing ES6, It was a lot to grasp and difficult wrap thing around in head. The Pathway below is design to be efficient in HTML, CSS and JS first. This is important as Learning react may look easy but while coding if the core of JavaScript is not clear, you will have huge trouble in debugging the code.

As you move along the parts, you dont directly start ReactJS coding, instead you first have to get accustomed to syntax like JSX, CSS as Objects and way to think before writing in ReactJS. Understand first what React does with light DOM using virtual DOM. Once, your mind is prepared, learning React becomes a hell lot easier. As you know React is just a library and final product (i.e. websites) is amalgamation of architecture and various technologies which are addons to React Library. Improper knowledge of this amalgamation results in destructive self growth in frontend technology.

## Part 1: Understanding HTML and CSS relation to Browser
This is first and foremost part every developer working with website should know. Forget JavaScript right now. JavaScript only won't make content appear on to browser but HTML and CSS will. 

Young developer are directly moved to React and Angular is a big red indicator for their personal development. Its not young developers are bad at HTMl/CSS. The major problem is not HTML/CSS but the exposure they are given to it. While taking interview many candidates directly jump on to technologies like Angular and ReactJS (JavaScript Framework) without understanding the internal workings of HTML and CSS.

Everything you see on the web is built on HTML and CSS. JavaScript only gives the interactiveness to a site. Now in the modern age, the site needs to work as an App. So JavaScript Frameworks are made to make the site work as an app. There is a major practice problem such that developers get too much involved in framework JS. I have heard developers losing grip on HTML and CSS as tickets have major work on App improvements bit and not UI changes. I recommend developer to practicing on developing an app from scratch, once a month, so they get full insight of how web architecture of SPA and PWA work around to generate HTML DOM and CSS.

- Clear Introduction
- HTML
- CSS
- Developer's insight into UI andÂ UX
- Essential HTML and CSS for SPA

## Part 2: Core of JavaScript
Once your core of javascript is strong, you can work in any front end Framework with ease. Using this knowledge you could earn the most merit in Web development on Apps like SPA and PWA. Many developers in interview study a lot on React and redux but fails to answer the core mechanisms on how object works. 70% developers in interview who know redux, fail to answer below example
```js
const a = { name: 'abc' };
const b = a;
b.name = 'xyz';
console.log(a.name); // Output is 'xyz'. I dont want object 'a' to change. How do I do that?
```
If you are unable to answer this you need to make you core knowledge of JavaScript stronger as knowing Redux means nothing if you can't solve this.
